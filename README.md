  This simple Unity Project is being made in order to learn how to use Unity. I will upload the project over the time.

The code is being written by me, however the art is not mine, it has been created by the user didigameboy (the user's profile can be easily find on The Unity Asset Store).

This game is based on the Contra/Probotector games made by Konami, specially on the first one for the NES.
